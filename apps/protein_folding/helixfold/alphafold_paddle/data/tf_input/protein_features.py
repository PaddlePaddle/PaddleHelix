  This is near identical to _get_tf_shape_no_placeholders() but with 2
  differences:
  * This method does not calculate a single placeholder from the total number of
    elements (eg given <NUM_RES, 3> and size := 12, this won't deduce NUM_RES
    must be 4)
  * This method will work with tensors

  Args:
    feature_name: String identifier for the feature. If the feature name ends
      with "_unnormalized", this suffix is stripped off.
    num_residues: The number of residues in the current domain - some elements
      of the shape can be dynamic and will be replaced by this value.
    msa_length: The number of sequences in the multiple sequence alignment, some
      elements of the shape can be dynamic and will be replaced by this value.
      If the number of alignments is unknown / not read, please pass None for
      msa_length.
    num_templates (optional): The number of templates in this tfexample.
    features: A feature_name to (tf_dtype, shape) lookup; defaults to FEATURES.

  Returns:
    List of ints representation the tensor size.

  Raises:
    ValueError: If a feature is requested but no concrete placeholder value is
        given.
