# ChemRL: Chemical Representation Learning

Effective molecular representation learning is of great importance to facilitate molecular property prediction, which is a fundamental task for the drug and material industry. To this end, we propose to utilize both more advanced neural network architectures and large-scale self-supervised learning strategies to largely boost the performance. [GEM](./GEM) is our first work which fully utilizes molecular geometries for network and self-supervised learning strategy designing. More works are coming soon.
