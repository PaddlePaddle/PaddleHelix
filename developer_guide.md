# Guide for developers

If you need to modify the algorithms/models in PaddleHelix, you have to switch to the developer mode. The core algorithms of PaddleHelix are mostly implemented in Python, but some also in C++, so you cannot develop PaddleHelix simply with `pip install --editable {pahelix_path}`. To develop on your machine, please do the following:

1. Please follow the [installation guide](./installation_guide.md) to install all dependencies of PaddleHelix (paddlepaddle >= 2.0.0rc0, pgl >= 1.2.0).

2. If you have already installed distributed PaddleHelix with `pip install paddlehelix`, please uninstall it with:

    ```bash
    pip uninstall paddlehelix
    ```

3. Clone this repository to your local machine, supposed path at "/path_to_your_repo/":

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleHelix.git /path_to_your_repo/
    cd /path_to_your_repo/
    ```

4. Depends on which model you'd like to modify, go to 4.1 or 4.2:

    4.1. LinearRNA
            
    The source code of LinearRNA is at "./c/pahelix/toolkit/linear_rna/linear_rna". You could modify it for your needs. Then remember to return to the root directory of the repository, run scripts below to re-compile (please ensure there are `cmake >= 3.6` and `g++ >= 4.8` on your machine):

    ```bash
    sh scripts/prepare.sh
    sh scripts/build.sh
    ```

    After a successful compilation, `import` LinearRNA as follows:

    ```bash
    cd build
    python
    >>> import c.pahelix.toolkit.linear_rna.linear_rna as linear_rna
    ```

    4.2. Other algorithms

    Except LinearRNA, other algorithms in PaddleHelix are all implemented in Python. If you want to change these algorithms, just find and modify corresponding `.py` files under the path "./pahelix", then add "/path_to_your_repo/" to your Python environment path:

    ```python
    import sys
    sys.path.append('/path_to_your_repo/')
    import pahelix
    ```
