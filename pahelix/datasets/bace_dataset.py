Processing of bace dataset.

It contains quantitative IC50 and qualitative (binary label) binding results for 
a set of inhibitors of human beta-secretase 1 (BACE=1).
The data are experimental values collected from the scientific literature which 
contains 152 compounds and their 2D structures and properties。


You can download the dataset from
http://moleculenet.ai/datasets-1 and load it into pahelix reader creators

    Description:
        
        The data file contains a csv table, in which columns below are used:
            
            mol: The smile representation of the molecular structure;
            
            pIC50: The negative log of the IC50 binding affinity;
            
            class: The binary labels for inhibitor.
   
    Args:
        data_path(str): the path to the cached npz path.
        task_names(list): a list of header names to specify the columns to fetch from 
            the csv file.
    
    Returns:
        an InMemoryDataset instance.
