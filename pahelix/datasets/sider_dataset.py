Processing of sider dataset.

The Side Effect Resource (SIDER) is a database of marketed drugs and adverse drug reactions (ADR). The version of the SIDER dataset in DeepChem has grouped drug side effects into 27 system organ classes following MedDRA classifications measured for 1427 approved drugs.

You can download the dataset from
http://moleculenet.ai/datasets-1 and load it into pahelix reader creators.

    Description:
        
        The data file contains a csv table, in which columns below are used:
            
            smiles:  SMILES representation of the molecular structure.
            
            Hepatobiliary disorders: Injury, poisoning and procedural complications, recorded side effects for the drug
    
    Args:
        data_path(str): the path to the cached npz path.
        task_names(list): a list of header names to specify the columns to fetch from 
            the csv file.
    
    Returns:
        an InMemoryDataset instance.
    
    Example:
