PaddleHelix team participated in multiple competitions related to bio-computing.

- We won the 2nd place in the [OGB-LCS KDD Cup 2021 PCQM4M-LSC track](https://ogb.stanford.edu/kddcup2021/results/), predicting DFT-calculated HOMO-LUMO energy gap of molecules. Please refer to [the solution](./kddcup2021-PCQM4M-LSC) for more details.

- We 1st in the ogbg-molhiv and ogbg-molpcba of [OGB](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/leader_graphprop/), predicting the molecular properties. Please refer to [the solution](./ogbg_molhiv) for more details.
