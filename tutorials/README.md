# Backgrouds

Machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL), is playing an increasingly important role in the pharmaceutical industry and bio-informatics. For instance, the DL-based methodology is found to predict the [drug-target interaction](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334088358_GraphDTA_prediction_of_drug-target_binding_affinity_using_graph_convolutional_networks) and [molecule properties](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30165565/) with reasonable precision and quite low computational cost, while those properties can only be accessed through *in vivo* / *in vitro* experiments or computationally expensive simulations (molecular dynamics simulation etc.) before. As another example, *in silico* [RNA folding](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344954534_LinearFold_Linear-Time_Prediction_of_RNA_Secondary_Structures) and [protein folding](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338619491_Improved_protein_structure_prediction_using_potentials_from_deep_learning) are becoming more likely to be accomplished with the help of deep neural models. The usage of ML and DL can greatly improve efficiency, and thus reduce the cost of drug discovery, vaccine design, etc.

In contrast to the powerful ability of DL metrics, a key challenge lying in utilizing them in the drug industry is the contradiction between the demand for huge data for training and the limited annotated data. Recently, there is tremendous success in adopting self-supervised learning in natural language processing and computer vision, showing that a large corpus of unlabeled data can be beneficial to learning universal tasks. In molecule representations, there is a similar situation. We have large amount of unlabeled data, including protein sequences (over 100 million) and compounds (over 50 million) but relatively small annotated data. It is quite promising to adopt DL-based pretaining technique in the representation learning of chemical compounds, proteins, RNA, etc.
